## Varnish Configuration Templates (boilerplate)

### Installation

You can use the configuration templates found in this repository to quickly get started with a complete Varnish configuration that offers support for most functionality. Start of by looking into "default.vcl" and taking the bits you need, copy it to your own default.vcl.

### What is it?

A set of configuration samples used for Varnish 4.0. This includes templates for:
* Wordpress
* Drupal (works decently for Drupal 7, depends on your modules obviously)
* Joomla (WIP)
* Fork CMS
* OpenPhoto

And various configuration for:

* Server-side URL rewriting
* Clean error pages for debugging
* Virtual Host implementations
* Various header normalizations
* Cookie manipulations
* 301/302 redirects from within Varnish
